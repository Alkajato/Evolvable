# Evolvable
A small genetic algorithm library I write whenever trying to learn a new language. I've uploaded the Rust version to make it easier to pull in the code with Cargo.

This includes a trait which can be implemented to allow the data type to work with evolve() and or par_evolve()

# Include 
[dependencies]
